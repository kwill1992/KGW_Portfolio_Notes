As you preview your book, chapters will be rendered and updated. However, if you make changes to global options (e.g. `_quarto.yml` or included files) you need to fully re-render your book to have all of the changes reflected. Consequently, you should always fully `quarto render` your site before deploying it, even if you have already previewed changes to some pages with the preview server.
:::

### Publishing

When you are ready to publish the book, use the `render` command to render all output formats:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto render
```

If you pass no arguments to `quarto render`, all formats will be rendered. You can also render individual formats via the `--to` argument:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto render           # render all formats
quarto render --to pdf  # render PDF format only
```

The output of your book will be written to the `_book` sub-directory of your book project:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
mybook/
  _book/
    index.html # and other book files
    mybook.pdf
    mybook.epub
```

See the documentation on [Publishing Websites](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/) for details on how to publish books to GitHub Pages, Netlify, and other services. Note that in that documentation the `output-dir` may be referred to as `_site`: for publishing books you should use `_book` rather than `_site`.


## To Publish to Quarto Pub  

## Publish Command

The `quarto publish` command is the easiest way to publish locally rendered content. From the directory where your project is located, execute the `quarto publish` command for Quarto Pub:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto publish quarto-pub
```

If you haven't published to Quarto Pub before, the publish command will prompt you to authenticate. After confirming that you want to publish, your content will be rendered and deployed, and then a browser opened to view your site.


## toc table of contents info  

<https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html>  
You can customize the table of contents (TOC) for HTML output formats using the `toc` option in your document or project YAML. Here are some common configurations:


- `toc: true` - Enables the TOC with default settings.
- `toc: false` - Disables the TOC.
- `toc: {depth: 2}` - Sets the depth of the TOC to 2 levels.
- `toc: {numbered: true}` - Enables numbered entries in the TOC.
- `toc: {float: true}` - Makes the TOC float alongside the content.
- `toc: {position: left}` - Positions the TOC on the left side of the page.
- `toc: {collapse: true}` - Allows sections in the TOC to be collapsible. 
You can combine these options as needed. For example, to create a floating, numbered TOC with a depth of 3 levels, you would use:    
```yaml
toc:
  depth: 3
  numbered: true
  float: true
```

## Tags

You can add tags to your Quarto documents using the `tags` field in the YAML front matter. Tags help categorize and organize your content, making it easier to find related documents. Here's how you can add tags:  
```yaml
---
title: "My Document"
tags: [data, analysis, R]
---  
```
In this example, the document is tagged with "data", "analysis", and "R".  
You can also add tags in a more structured way using a list:  
```yaml
---
title: "My Document"
tags:
  - data
  - analysis
  - R
---  
```
Tags can be used for filtering and searching within your Quarto projects, especially when you have multiple documents. They can also be useful for generating tag clouds or lists of related content if you are building a website or blog with Quarto.

### Invisible tags when rendered  
You can add invisible tags to your Quarto documents by using HTML comments in the YAML front matter. This way, the tags will not be displayed in the rendered output but will still be present in the source code for organizational purposes. Here's how you can do it:  
```yaml
---
title: "My Document"
<!--
tags: [data, analysis, R]
-->
---
```
In this example, the tags "data", "analysis", and "R" are included in an HTML comment, making them invisible in the rendered document.  
You can also use a list format within the HTML comment:  
```yaml
---
title: "My Document"
<!--
tags:
  - data
  - analysis
  - R
-->
---
```
This method allows you to keep your tags organized without displaying them in the final output.  

<!-- tags: projects, git, rstudio, ideas -->
