As you preview your book, chapters will be rendered and updated. However, if you make changes to global options (e.g. `_quarto.yml` or included files) you need to fully re-render your book to have all of the changes reflected. Consequently, you should always fully `quarto render` your site before deploying it, even if you have already previewed changes to some pages with the preview server.

### Publishing

When you are ready to publish the book, use the `render` command to render all output formats:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto render
```

If you pass no arguments to `quarto render`, all formats will be rendered. You can also render individual formats via the `--to` argument:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto render           # render all formats
quarto render --to pdf  # render PDF format only
```

The output of your book will be written to the `_book` sub-directory of your book project:

``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
mybook/
  _book/
    index.html # and other book files
    mybook.pdf
    mybook.epub
```

See the documentation on [Publishing Websites](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/) for details on how to publish books to GitHub Pages, Netlify, and other services. Note that in that documentation the `output-dir` may be referred to as `_site`: for publishing books you should use `_book` rather than `_site`.
